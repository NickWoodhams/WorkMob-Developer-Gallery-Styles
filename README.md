WorkMob-Developer-Gallery-Styles
================================

Stylesheets for the http://theworkmob.com developer galleries

The base gallery uses default Bootstrap v3.0.3 styles, then additional styles are added by gallery.css. The gallery.css file is generated by gallery.less. 

Your custom styles will be loaded after gallery.css.
